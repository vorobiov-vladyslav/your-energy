# Your Energy

A fitness-oriented web application that lets users browse a rich catalogue of
exercises, filter them by muscle group, body part, or equipment, save favourites
for later, and leave star ratings. The app is fully responsive across mobile,
tablet, and desktop breakpoints and is built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS custom
properties, and Vite.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the project locally:

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server at localhost:5173
npm run build    # Production build to dist/
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## API Documentation

The back-end API that powers exercise data, quotes, and ratings is documented
via Swagger:
